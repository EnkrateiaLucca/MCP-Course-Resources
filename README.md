# Getting Started with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A comprehensive course on building AI agent applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) - the new open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources.

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course teaches you how to build production-ready AI applications using MCP, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced integrations with Claude Code and Cursor. You'll learn to create servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts that AI assistants can use to perform real-world tasks.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

- **MCP Fundamentals**: Understand the architecture, components, and communication flow
- **Building MCP Servers**: Create servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts
- **Client Implementation**: Build clients that connect to MCP servers
- **Transport Protocols**: Master both stdio and HTTP transport mechanisms
- **Real-world Integration**: Deploy MCP servers with Claude Code and Cursor
- **Best Practices**: Security, error handling, and production deployment

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with async/await concepts (helpful but not required)
- Command line/terminal experience

@mcp.tool()
def create_file(path: str, content: str) -> dict:
    """Create a file with specified content"""
    with open(path, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
    return {"created": path, "size": len(content)}
```

### File Manager Server (Lesson 6)
