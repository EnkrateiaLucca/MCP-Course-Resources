# Lesson 2: MCP Components & Capabilities

## Overview
Deep dive into the core components of MCP and the capabilities they provide.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the three main components: Host, Client, and Server
- Learn about the four core capabilities: Tools, Resources, Prompts, and Sampling
- Explore how components interact with each other

## Key Components
1. **Host**: The application that runs MCP (e.g., Claude Desktop, VS Code)
2. **Client**: Manages connections and routes messages
3. **Server**: Exposes tools, resources, and prompts

## Core Capabilities
1. **Tools**: Functions that can be called by the AI
2. **Resources**: Data sources that can be accessed
3. **Prompts**: Pre-defined prompt templates
4. **Sampling**: LLM text generation capabilities
