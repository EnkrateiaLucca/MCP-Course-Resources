# MCP Fundamentals: Message Protocol & JSON-RPC

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol used by MCP
- Identify the three types of messages in MCP communication
- Explain the client-server interaction lifecycle
- Recognize the transport mechanisms available in MCP

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) uses a standardized communication protocol to enable seamless interaction between clients and servers. This lesson explores the messaging rules and communication patterns that make MCP work effectively.

## The JSON-RPC 2.0 Protocol

MCP leverages JSON-RPC 2.0 as its messaging protocol, which defines the rules for communication between:

- **Client**: The application making requests
- **Server**: The service responding to requests

## Message Types in MCP

### 1. Request Messages

Sent from client to server, containing:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the request
- **Method**: The function or tool being invoked
- **Parameters**: Arguments for the specific function

### 2. Response Messages

Sent from server to client, containing:

- **ID**: Same as the corresponding request ID
- **Result**: Data returned on successful execution
- **Error**: Error message if execution fails

### 3. Notification Messages

One-way messages that don't expect a response:

- Typically sent from server to client
- Can also be sent from client to server (e.g., during initialization)
- Used to indicate state changes or provide updates

## Transport Mechanisms

MCP supports two types of transport:

### Local Transport

- Uses **STDIO** (Standard Input/Output)
- For communication within the same machine
- Involves running commands to local scripts

### Remote Transport

- Previously used Server-Sent Events (SSE) - now deprecated
- Currently uses **Streamable HTTP**
- Enables communication across networks

## Client-Server Interaction Lifecycle

The MCP interaction follows four distinct stages:

### 1. Initialization Stage

```
Client → Server: Initialize request
Server → Client: Protocol version and capabilities
Client → Server: Confirmation notification
```

- Client initiates connection
- Server responds with its version and capabilities
- Client confirms successful initialization

### 2. Discovery Stage

```
Client → Server: Request available capabilities
Server → Client: List of available tools
```

- Client explores what the server can do
- Server provides comprehensive list of tools and functions
- Example: The `list_tools` request demonstrated in previous lessons

### 3. Execution Stage

```
Client → Server: Tool invocation request
Server → Client: Progress notifications (optional)
Server → Client: Final response with results
```

- Client invokes specific capabilities based on needs
- Server may send progress updates during execution
- Server returns final results upon completion

### 4. Termination Stage

```
Client → Server: Shutdown request
Server → Client: Acknowledgment
Client: Exits connection
```

- Client initiates graceful shutdown
- Server acknowledges the request
- Connection is properly closed

## Practical Implications

Understanding the MCP protocol helps you:

- Build more robust MCP servers and clients
- Debug communication issues effectively
- Design better integration patterns
- Optimize message flow for your use cases

While you don't need deep protocol knowledge to use MCP, understanding these fundamentals equips you to create more sophisticated and reliable implementations.

## Key Takeaways

1. MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for standardized messaging
2. Three message types enable flexible communication patterns
3. Both local and remote transport options are available
4. The four-stage lifecycle ensures proper connection management
5. Protocol knowledge enhances your ability to build effective MCP solutions

## Next Steps

With this foundation in MCP's communication protocol, you're ready to explore more advanced topics like building custom MCP servers and implementing complex tool interactions.
