# MCP Communication Flow

## Overview
The MCP communication process follows a structured flow from user request to final response, involving all four core components working in sequence.

## Step-by-Step Communication Process

### 1. User Interaction
- User sends prompt/query to host application
- Initial request triggers the MCP workflow

### 2. Host Processing
- Host application receives user request
- LLM processes and understands the initial query
- Host identifies need for external capabilities

### 3. Client Connection & Capability Discovery
- Host connects to appropriate MCP server via dedicated client
- Client performs **capability discovery** query to server
- Server returns available capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)
- Information relayed back: Server → Client → Host

### 4. Capability Invocation
- LLM in host application decides which capabilities to use
- Host sends specific capability requests through client
- Examples: "send email," "create files," "fetch data"

### 5. Server Execution
- Client handles execution call processing
- Server receives and executes requested functions
- Actual task performance occurs at server level

### 6. Results Integration
- Server returns execution results to client
- Client relays results back to host application
- LLM integrates results into context
- Host generates final response incorporating all executed actions

## Communication Flow Summary
**User Request** → **Host Processing** → **Capability Discovery** → **Capability Invocation** → **Server Execution** → **Results Integration** → **Final User Response**

This flow ensures seamless integration of external capabilities while maintaining security and proper orchestration between all MCP components.
